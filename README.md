# 30-days-of-code
## Hello Coders!!

Welcome to my 30 Days of coding challenge! This is my coding journey of how I get consistent and fall in love with coding, so I thought to share it with all those who want to get started with coding but struggle to be consistent.

## AIM:
- To help beginners get started with problem-solving efficiently and consistently.
- Hope it `pushes` someone to`commit` to solving problems and save changes to see the change :D
- This is going to make my day productive, and I hope it does the same for you too!
  
This repo is not just about how I build consistency, but I hope it helps anyone to start their challenge to improve productivity and consistency as well.
I have started; when are you going to??
 
Let's code and feel good :D
